        This will be a personal portfolio piece. I like this current layout, 
        where it has a quick blurb about themselves at the top with an 
        interesting graphic and divisions, and under that will be my pieces 
        of work that I'd like to show off. I plan to have the top half of the 
        page be an introduction to me, then the bottom half will be my latest 
        work, then some upcoming projects.
